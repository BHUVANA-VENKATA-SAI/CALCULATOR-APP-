# CALCULATOR-APP-
This Python script is a simple calculator built with Tkinter, a GUI library. It has a window titled "Calculator" with buttons for digits, operators (+, -, *, /), clear (C), and equals (=). The user inputs expressions displayed in a text box. Pressing "=" evaluates the expression; "C" clears it.
